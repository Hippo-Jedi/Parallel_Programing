Instructions:

1. Navigate to the directory with the all04.cpp in it. Make sure you are on the flip server otherwise you will get a seg fault.

2. Run "g++ all04.cpp -o all04 -lm -fopenmp " to create an executable file called "all04". Then run "./all04" to see the output with the a single array size.

3. If you wish to create a .csv file and write outputs to it with multiple array sizes, run "csh loop.sh >& proj4.csv". I formatted the outputs for a csv file.
